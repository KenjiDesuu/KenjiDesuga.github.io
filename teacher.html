                <h1>Java Mint Latte</h1>
                <a>
                    The <strong>Java Mint Latte</strong> is a unique and healthful coffee drink made with <strong>jackfruit meat</strong> and coffee. 
                    It's a novel coffee with the distinct flavors of espresso and fresh peppermint leaves. The rich, freshly roasted scent of coffee is combined with the sweet, 
                    aromatic tones of mint to create a delicious and refreshing coffee. It has a number of advantages, including greater concentration and focus that you may need handling students and papers, 
                    increased energy levels, and less weariness means that it can help you relax after a stressful day of teaching. It is a delicious way to start the day and can be served hot or iced.</a>
